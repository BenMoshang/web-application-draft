/*===================================================
     Mixins

     Note: Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be used to apply styles to elements.

     however they are diffrent than global classes. Global classes are written once and compiled once.
     
     - think that mixins are a type of shorthand of a collection of properties. instead.
